# Static Boilerplate

## What's Included

A simple project boilerplate for testing small ideas quickly in an HTML document with JavaScript and CSS. The goal of this project was not to provide a replacement for the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) but rather a light static HTML environment for simple TDD JavaScript prototyping with all one needs to get started and nothing more. You'll find:

- [Grunt](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) to compile, minify and watch [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jasmine (Standalone)](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/) for JavaScript testing
- Semantic HTML5

## What's Not Included

- a server
- page analytics
- superfluous libraries
- legacy browser support
